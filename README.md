# Employee Attrition 
Employee attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced. When attrition crosses a particular threshold, it becomes a cause for concern. Therefore predicting why employees leave can provide insights which can help lower the attrition rate

# Employee Attrition Modelling
* This model predicts employee attrition using logistic regression from sklearn library. 
* We have an existing dataset of 1470 employees with various features like age, department, and distance from home that can affect employee attrition.
* We draw insights by plotting various graphs and statistics using matplotlib and numpy
* We split the data into train and test sets on ratio of 0.3 and feed the train data to the model
* We get score using LR model and calculate probability, ROC-AUC and accuracy score
* Precision, recall, f1-score, support are also calculated to give better insights

  
# Python libraries used 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* Patsy and dmatrices
